# Privacy Policy

When you login using GitHub or Google, I (Jed Thompson) store the relative account information:

- GitHub
  - Email
  - Display Name
  - Username
  - Avatar Photo
- Google
  - To be filled

I also store the polls that you have created and any votes you make on options.

I am the Data Controller and can be contacted at `jedster1111@hotmail.co.uk`. The information is used for when you create a poll, or for when you vote on an option within a poll. I don't share the data with any third parties. Currently there is no way for a user to remove user data themselves.  

I'm meant to tell you your 8 GDPR rights but I don't think you have them at the moment...
